RISC-V Assembler
A straightforward assembler that transforms RISC-V RV32I assembly code into binary machine code.

Features
- Compatible with the RV32I instruction set.  
- Converts assembly into 32-bit RISC-V machine code.  
- Outputs binary files for simulation or execution.

How to Use
1. Write your RISC-V assembly code.  
2. Execute the assembler to generate the corresponding machine code.  
3. Use the generated binary with a simulator or emulator.
