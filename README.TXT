A lightweight RISC-V simulator that decodes and executes RV32I machine code like a real CPU.
Features
Instruction Decoding: Supports RISC-V RV32I instruction set.
Execution Engine: Simulates CPU registers, memory, and PC updates.
Binary Loader: Loads pre-assembled RISC-V machine code.
Usage
Assemble RISC-V code using riscv-as or any assembler.
Load the binary into the simulator.
Step through execution and observe register/memory changes.
